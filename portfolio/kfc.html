    <meta property="og:description" content="KFC is a dominant player in Russia's fast food market, with over 960 restaurants and the second-highest sales growth globally after China. However, its existing website was outdated and ineffective in converting visitors into customers. At LETO agency, I led the redesign of the new KFC website, with a strong focus on mobile experience and real-time content personalization based on user data." />
